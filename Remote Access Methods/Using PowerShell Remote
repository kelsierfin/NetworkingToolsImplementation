## Environment / Setup
- **Target Computer:** Workstation under test  
- **Admin Computer:** Technicianâ€™s computer  
- **Destination:** ISP gateway  

## Steps Performed
1. On the target computer, opened PowerShell.

   ```  
3. On the admin computer, opened PowerShell.  
4. Initiated a remote session to the target computer.  
5. Ran the traceroute command to the ISP gateway:  
   ```powershell
   tracert <ISP_Gateway_IP>
   ```  
6. Observed the results to confirm ISP connectivity.  

## Key Takeaways
- PowerShell remoting allows remote troubleshooting without visiting the userâ€™s desk.  
- `tracert` can confirm connectivity to the ISP gateway.  

## Real-World Application
This method can be used in large networks to quickly test and verify user connectivity without physical access.
